## Executive Summary
This analysis provide a summary of customers across different markets and their top purchases category, revenue per country, leading customers, and sales trend from total of 1,000 cases and 28 rows of data. Notably, the total purchases for the top categories decline significantly in the fourth quarter of 2024. However, categories such as Luxury Goods, Jewelry & Accessories, and Sports & Outdoors see a noticeable increase in sales during this period. These insights suggest a product categories shift throughout the year, and consumers' behavior are affected seasonaly. This explains the suddent spike in sales during November as people starts to holiday shop and purchasing gifts.

## Recommendations
- **Capitalize on spending patterns**: Analyze where customers are spending their money each month to strategically capitalize on all revenue opportunities and maximize overall profits.
  
- **Target underperforming markets**: Companies should target countries with consumers who have strong spending potential, like the Philippines, to drive increased product purchases.
  
- **Incentivize spending with rewards**: Make products more affordable or implement a reward program for customers with lower spending power to encourage purchases and attract additional customers.
